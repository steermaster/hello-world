hello

I'm steermaster. I am currently looking to get some practice coding and other areas that might help me in pursueing a job with the web development degree I obtained 6 years ago. I currently work in a manufacturing facility as a shipper and have for several years. When I began my education with the University of Phoenix, I was hoping my employer would be able to assist my ambitions by aiding me in obtaining experience in programs they were working on. I have had no success taking this route, so I am currently looking for a way to use this degree, which has so far been a waste.
